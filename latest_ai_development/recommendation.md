Best Product Recommendation for "Looking for a petrol car under 15 lakhs with max mileage of 50,000 km"**

After analyzing the specifications, safety features, performance, and pros and cons of each product, I recommend the **Honda City (4th Generation)** as the best-matching product that meets the user's needs. Here's a detailed comparison of the three products to justify this recommendation:

**Fuel Mileage:**
All three cars offer competitive fuel mileage, with the Honda City and Hyundai Verna delivering up to 19 kmpl, while the Maruti Suzuki Ciaz achieves up to 20.2 kmpl. Although the Ciaz has a slight edge in fuel efficiency, the difference is minimal, and the City's features and other benefits outweigh this slight disadvantage.

**Safety Features:**
The Hyundai Verna has some additional advanced safety features like Driver Attention Warning, ISOFIX Mounting Points, and a more comprehensive suite of airbags. However, the Honda City has an impressive array of standard safety features, including dual front airbags, anti-lock braking, and electronic brakeforce distribution, making it a close second in terms of safety.

**Performance:**
The Honda City's 1.5-litre i-VTEC engine delivers 119 PS of maximum power, while the Hyundai Verna's 1.5-litre VTVT engine produces 115 PS. Although the Verna is slightly more powerful, the City's more efficient engine and smooth ride experience make up for this difference.

**Interior Space:**
The Honda City offers an impressive interior space, with roomy rear seats and ample boot space. While the Hyundai Verna has a stylish interior, its rear seat legroom is slightly compromised compared to the City.

**Ground Clearance:**
All three cars have a respectable ground clearance, with the Honda City and Hyundai Verna offering 165 mm and 160 mm, respectively, while the Ciaz has 185 mm. However, the difference in ground clearance between the City and the Ciaz is minimal and not a significant concern.

**Price:**
The Honda City's price range of ₹10.99 lakh to ₹13.99 lakh falls within the budget of ₹15 Lakhs, making it an excellent value for money.

Although the Hyundai Verna has some additional safety features, the Honda City's overall package and balance of features make it the best choice for this user.
